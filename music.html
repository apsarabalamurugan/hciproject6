    <h1>Displaced Composition</h1>
    <div class = "music-description">
        <p>I wrote a composition called "Displaced" to raise awareness of the refugee crises. But I didn't want to make it political. I wanted to make it relatable by positioning it as a humanitarian crises and not a political one. </p>
        <p>I believe that music can reach into people's hearts, more so than words or images.  So, I wrote a piece that was rooted in the sentiment of uncertainty and not quite belonging.  We all can relate to that feeling.  That's how I reached my performers and by extension the audience.</p>
        <p>It was also a symbolic performance because I wrote the piece to include classic, choral and jazz themes and that brought in performers from a variety of groups/cliques in my school.</p>
        <p>All of us coming together in that way to share in a common experience for a common cause was unifying and powerful. </p>
