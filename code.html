    <!-- Project Title and Description -->
    <h1>KPI Generation Project</h1>
    <div class = "code-description" >
        <p> I led and implemented a solution to optimize the generation of KPIs for geolocation accuracy using dynamic SQL queries in Apache Superset. </p>
        <p> To do this, I had to first analyze the existing static Python script to figure out its design flaws and potential ways to improve its accuracy and efficiency.  </p>
        <p> Second, after deciding that running SQL queries would expedite the process, I began developing these queries to be able to extract the most relevant statistics from the large geolocation database in an efficient way.  </p>
        <p> Once I had figured out the implementation of these queries, I evaluated Apache Superset to ensure charts, tables, and heat maps could be utilized efficiently.  </p>
        <p>Lastly, I led department-wide tutorial sessions during the rollout of the functionality. </p>
